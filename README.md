jquery-ancestor
===============

A jQuery plugin for shitty web developers who have never heard of id attributes.

If you actually use this code in production, you are a horrible person who should probably give up programming and take up goat farming.

This plugin was created after encountering a seven level nested parent() call running in production. I figure that if you're going to write shitty code, you may as well use a shitty plugin to save some keystrokes.
